# Traveling in Russia

The project aims to attract tourists to explore Russia as a vacation destination. The website showcases interesting places to visit, even those that many have heard of but never had the opportunity to experience firsthand.

The website is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring seamless viewing across all modern devices.

The project is developed using HTML and CSS, with the inclusion of the normalize.css file; no third-party libraries were utilized.

You can view the website [here](https://otec-s.github.io/russian-travel/).

Enjoy exploring!
